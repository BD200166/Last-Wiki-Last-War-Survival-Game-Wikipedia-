            <h3>Radar Missions and Stacking</h3>
            <p>
                On the odd numbered days of Alliance Duel, your earn a great deal of points from<br> 
                completing radar missions. For this reason, it's very effective to stack radar missions on the days when<br> 
                they don't earn Duel points. To stack radar misssions, you complete the activity but DON'T COLLECT it once done.<br> 
                You leave it on the screen with its red dot. That will prevent it from expiring. To avoid shifting your time, try to<br>
                stack at 1 less than max (eg 34/35). If you do want to shift your refresh time, let it stack to max (eg 35/35) and collect<br> 
                one radar mission at the time you want to set as refresh. See linked post for graphic about that.<br>
                <br>
                You can send 4 trucks daily (by default), and you can refresh a truck with Trade Contracts that you earn<br> 
                from various sources. Keep 40 trade contracts in stock so that you can refresh all 4 trucks to UR on<br> 
                days 2 & 6 of Alliance Duel. You can send a certain number of Secret Mobile Team explorations each day<br> 
                (number depending on level). You can refresh the whole list of unstarted missions using Secret Orders that<br> 
                you earn from various sources. However, it's best to save Secret Orders to refresh on Days 2 & 6 of Alliance Duel<br> 
                until you get between 4 and 6 gold secret missions. Make sure to start the gold missions before refreshing the list.<br> 
                To aid ally secret mission, it's as simple as going to second tab and aiding them when their exploration is complete.<br> 
                To loot other explorations, you have to look for them on the world map manually, which you can only see at certain<br>
                zoom levels.<br>
                <br>
                Last note about Duel. All the smart players save their hero shards and skill medals to use only on Day 4 of Duel each week.<br> 
                You're here reading a guide, so you're a smart player too!
            </p>
        <h2 id="PvP">PvP</h2>
            <p>
                First, let's talk about Base Defense. You should only try to defend if your main squad can survive in the first attack or<br> 
                second successive attack (i.e., the attacker is around your level and spending habits).<br>
                <br> 
                If you can't defend or can't be online to make that determination, DISABLE your defenses.<br>
                How to enable/disable defenses. Go to the Wall in your base, click the House+ icon and uncheck the squads. Any time<br> 
                you unlock a new squad, make sure to uncheck them too. Sometimes it makes sense to have zero defense, and sometimes it<br> 
                makes sense to have main squad as defense, but having your weaker squads participate in defense is the biggest mistake<br> 
                you can make.<br>
                <br> 
                Why this works: Let's say a much stronger player attacks you 5 times (assuming you're level 20 with 3 squads).<br> 
                You would lose about 10k to 12k troops in those 5 attacks if you had 3 defense teams. If you had only a single<br> 
                defense (strongest squad), you'd lose about 4k to 5k troops. If you had no defense at all, you'd lose about 1k troops (due to<br> 
                breach attack, which doesn't count as kills for attacker). It's a huge difference.<br>
                <br>
                Attacking bases serves two purposes in this game: (1) to plunder resources and (2) to earn points during Kill Events, such as<br> 
                Enemy Buster (Day 6 of Duel)<br>
                <br>
                Plundering gives the best resource to stamina ratio in the game, but be mindfull of defenses/retaliation, your current plunder<br> 
                limits, etc. There's a separate guide that goes more into it (⁠tips-strategies ⁠Attacking Commanders to Gain Re…)<br>
                When attacking other bases for Kill Events, note that only battles can give kills for points. So, someone with no defense<br> 
                or no troops won't earn you any event points or increase your individual kill count. That's the other reason for disabling your<br> 
                own defenses, which is to prevent your opponents from earning points from attacking you.
            </p>
        <h2 id="PvP cont'd">PvP cont'd</h2>
            <p>
                You can attack bases far from you without giving them too much warning by redirecting your squad to attack at the last moment.<br> 
                Furthermore, your primary squad marches about 3 times faster (if garage 1 researched far enough) to resources than they do to a base<br> 
                or zombie. That means instead of marching to a base for 1 minute (giving them and their alliance warning), you can do a 20 second<br> 
                march and sneak attack.<br>
                <br>
                Pay attention to the power rating of your opponent as a way to predict if they have troops in base. You'll eventually get a feel for<br> 
                how to predict if they have 0 troops, a few thousand troops, or a full drill ground. Examine the battle report after your first attack.<br>
                It is an absolute waste to use your secondary squads to land an attack on an opponent's base because (A) your weaker squads have a greater<br> 
                chance of failing and (B) they have a lower load capacity for plundering. You can use your second squad as a feint attack, but withdraw<br> 
                before it lands (if you're trying to draw your opponent into attacking you when thinking your base is only weakly defended)<br>
                <br>
                Lastly, zeroing bases is something the developers want you to do because it encourages spending. However, it's actually counterproductive<br> 
                in most situations. There are several reasons why it's not good to zero bases, but instead I'll state when it is productive: (1) you need<br> 
                that base gone such as a strong attacker whose squad is out marching, (2) earning points in Zonewar Duel and it's an enemy server base<br>
            </p>
        <h2 id="Team Composition">Team Composition</h2>
            <p>
                First, for every squad, put 2 Defenders (shield icons) in the front row and 3 Attackers in back row. This is due to the mechanics of battle.<br>
                Every character has an auto attack aka basic attack, a fatal skill, an upgradable passive, and a 4-star passive.<br>
                <br>
                What makes an attacker good in their role is a fatal skill that deals damage (even better if it has secondary effect like targeting back<br> 
                row or causing buff/debuff) and a damage boosting passive. Read Stetmann's skills to see why he is currently one of the best attackers to have<br> 
                (this is not an endorsement to purchase him).<br>
                <br>
                What makes a defender good in their role is a fatal skill and passive that increases their own or the whole team's survivability.<br> 
                Read Carlie's skills to see why she's such a great defender (not the best because she is niche but still great). In the case of<br> 
                Carlie, it's not just her skills, but it's also because she is Aircraft (and most players use tanks). Aircraft faction receives<br> 
                only 80% damage from Tank Faction. In the same Rock/Paper/Scissors mechanics of the game, Tank Faction receives only 80% damage from<br> 
                Artillery Faction, and Artillery Faction receives only 80% damage from Aircraft Faction.<br>
                <br>
                UR heroes are generally better than SSR heroes but only when they don't trail too far behind in the total number of stars and levels.<br> 
                So, your newly acquired 0 star DVA shouldn't be replacing any 2-5 star SSR, but if you get her to 3 stars, have her replace any 5 star SSR attacker.<br>
                <br>
                Characters receive a MASSIVE buff in performance when reaching 4 stars, so prioritize getting everyone<br> 
                on your team to that before going too heavy into reaching 5 stars.
            </p>
        <h2 id="Team Composition cont'd">Team Composition cont'd</h2>
            <p>
                Gear allocation is something I see many many players handle ineffectively.<br>
                <br>
                When equipping and leveling gear, you'll actually want to prioritize defense gear (i.e. gold armor and gold radar) for your<br> 
                defenders and attack gear (gold gun and gold data chip) for your attackers. That means the very last thing you would do is equip<br> 
                a gold gun on Murphy and level it, but 90-95% of players do this very early not realizing how ineffective it is.<br>
                <br>
                After you've gotten your prioritized gear sorted, you can work on putting some gold defense gear on your attackers, then gold data<br>  
                chips on your defenders (to level 20 for damage resistance and extra HP), and lastly gold guns on your defenders (for a little extra defense).<br> 
                <br>
                Marshall is a support character rather than an explicit attacker and defender, but between those two roles, he actually does better as a<br> 
                defender in the front row if you don't have two UR defenders sufficiently tiered.<br>
            </p>
        <h2 id="Alliance Exercise - Marshal Guard">Alliance Exercise - Marshal Guard</h2>
            <p>
                An alliance with a whale account can knock out the damage requirements quickly, but for everyone else, a sound strategy is needed<br> 
                to do the most damage possible.<br>
                <br>
                To explain this strategy, I'm going to use an example of there being 10 members online and ready to go when you start the exercise.<br>
                <br>
                Each member starts a rally in about 30 second intervals. It's important to not start them all at the same time. You only have to think<br> 
                about this for the first 4-5 minutes to establish a good rhythm.<br>
                The rallies are led by each member's second squad. The reason is to make the main squad free to join any rally as often as possible.<br>
                Everyone joins the shortest available rally with their main squad. When the rhythm is right, you end up attacking about every 2-3 minutes.<br>
                If there are open spots, don't worry. When there are 30 seconds remaining to a Marshal Guard rally, it will auto fill with the strongest<br> 
                squads available (including offline members).<br>
                The two biggest obstacles to doing this right are (A) members starting too many rallies at the same time, breaking the rhythm and reducing<br> 
                how many times you can attack with main squad, and (B) members joining rallies with their weak teams, which takes up spots that could have<br> 
                otherwise been filled with a team that can actually do damage.<br>
                <br>
                Note that at time of this posting, your damage done decreases with each increasing level of alliance guard. For simplicity, let's just say it<br> 
                decreases by half with each level. So, the difficulty in obtaining max rewards increases exponentially with level.
            </p>
        <h2 id="Troop/Unit Training">Troop/Unit Training</h2>
            <p>
                The most optimal troop training strategy is to train them in 3 stages. This doesn't make training any faster or use any fewer resources, but it<br> 
                allows you to increase your point scoring during relevant events such as unit training in Arms Race and Duel's Day 5 Activity.<br>
                <br>
                Lets say TX=max level of troop you can train, TY=one level below max, and TZ=two levels below max. The strategy is to train TZ all throughout<br> 
                the week (assuming you already have enough TX for all your squads). During Unit Training of Arms Race, promote TZ—>TY and/or TY—>TX (possible to<br> 
                do two rounds in each barracks without speedups during that phase). During Day 5 of Duel, you would promote all or nearly all TY/TZ to TX throughout<br> 
                the day before going into Desert Storm Battlefield or Day 6 of Duel. Then, once you're done with Kill Events, resume with restocking TZ.<br>
                <br>
                As an example, if you are HQ 25, then TX would be level 8 units (requiring lv24 barracks), TY would be lv 7 units (requiring lv20 barracks), and TZ<br> 
                would be lv 6 units (requiring lv17 barracks)<br>
                <br>
                To make use of this strategy, you need to keep some barracks at lower levels than the max possible. Out of 4 barracks, I suggest keeping 2 that can<br> 
                train to TX and 2 that can only train up to TY. This is because promoting troops automatically goes to max level for that barracks.<br>
                When healing from the hospital, it's usually better to repair in smaller doses rather than all at the same time. Note that although you have<br> 
                multiple hospital buildings in your base, they all basically function as a single hospital.<br>
                Plan space in drill grounds around being able to train 2k new troops daily (estimate based on 4 barracks).<br>

        <h2 id="Auto Rally">Auto Rally</h2>
            <p>
                Automatically enabled for everyone in the alliance once you've finished the one-time alliance research. Works for boomers - open spots<br> 
                automatically fill after 40 seconds have passed on rally timer, drawing the weakest squad and 5 units from any member. Works for<br> 
                Marshal Guard — open spots automatically fill when 30 seconds remain on rally timer with strongest available squad and full units.<br>
            </p>
        <h2 id="Zombie Invasion">Zombie Invasion</h2>
            <p>
                The first error people make when encountering Zombie Invasion for the first time is they add all the combat power in the rally and think<br> 
                it will work if it's greater than the recommended power. That's not a reliable way to determine it.<br>
                You'll want to have someone close to the recommended power leading the rally, and then weaker members can join later.<br>
                <br>
                Don't base it on summed power. Need to have each individual with about 60-80% of the recommended power (this is not exact). You'll get<br> 
                a feel for what you need to take out each level of zombie boss as the event goes on<br>
                <br>
                As an example, 5 players with 1.6M power will get wiped in all 5 rounds against a level 5 without making a dent.<br> 
                However, 2 players with 4M power could almost take it depending on how your teams are built. Lead with the strongest<br> 
                and have the weaker players join last for potential cleanup (when the rounds get easier). Also, everyone should be<br> 
                sending only their main team unless the ones who joined are already guaranteed to win and you're just filling the rally to launch.<br>

        <h2 id="Desert Storm Battlefield">Desert Storm Battlefield</h2>
            <p>
                Because true matchmaking doesn't exist yet for DSB, I won't write up a comprehensive guide. Right now, most opponents are selected as<br> 
                developers pick winners and losers creating massively unbalanced matches, so nothing you do will change which side wins.<br>
                <br>
                However, there is still the aspect of earning individual points for a separate section of rewards for participants . If there is no<br> 
                opponent to meet you in battle, it is currently impossible to get 200k individual points with only 3 squads.<br>
                <br>
                When you have uneven matches (one side greatly outnumbers their opponent or greatly overpowers their opponent with similar number of participants)<br> 
                it's actually not a very good strategy to attack bases. This is because successful base attacks cause units to perish: those units don't earn points<br> 
                for anyone, and they are gone from battlefield forever. You're basically throwing points away. So, there are two ways to increase individual points<br> 
                for everyone (both sides) in uneven matches<br><br>
                Keep all battles in structures or at the oil fields.<br>
                Continuously change structure ownership to create structure breach points (boxes that have to be collected with scout planes).<br>
                Coordination between your alliance and opponent alliance<br>
                <br>
                If/when they fix this to be a balanced mode, all that changes because then there's an actual battle with numerous strategies available.<br>

        <h2 id="Spending Diamonds">Spending Diamonds</h2>
            <p>
                Here are some places where I spend my diamonds (keeping in mind that I don't buy diamonds).<br>
                <br>
                - 300/week for stamina potions in VIP shop<br>
                - 10k/month for activating VIP (not the best value)<br>
                - 770/week on alliance tech donations (10 donations daily with diamonds)<br>
                - Some varying amount buying XP chests from VIP shop<br>
                - Some amount in events to get to next threshold of rewards<br>
                - On some days, I might buy 300 gem and possibly 500 gem stamina refreshes<br>
                <br>
                If it's a really good event and my potions are low (like during zombie invasion during stamina phase of arms race). I don't do this daily though.<br>
                <br>
                All the above usually keeps my supply pretty low<br>
                Here are examples of the WORST ways to spend diamonds:<br><br>
                - Anything from the "Diamond" Shop<br>
                - Any "Finish Now" prompts<br>
                - Buying shields with diamonds<br>
                - Speeding marches with diamonds<br>
                - Pure chance events with no guaranteed pulls after x attempts<br>
                - Any event where you have to spend money to claim rewards you drew with diamonds (like that summon supplies bullshit where you have to buy keys)<br>
                - VIP activation for only 1 day (about 3x the cost of monthly)<br>
            </p>
        <h2 id="City Capture - an addendum">City Capture - an addendum</h2>
            <p>
                You can hold only 6 cities regardless of level. The Capitol is not considered part of this limit (i.e., 7 territories if you also hold Capitol)<br>
                You can declare war on only 3 cities each day. You can also only declare war on one city at a time, which will last until the city<br> 
                is captured or the 12 h timer expires.<br>
                <br>
                You can repeat march when attacking a city similar to something you do when plundering a dead base<br>
                You can release cities by way of an abandonment process that takes one hour.<br>
                The buffs of gold/food/iron output are the most useless buffs. Gathering bonus speed is good for events particularly activity points<br> 
                for day 1 of Duel. The best buffs are for construction and research speed.<br>
                <br>
                If your alliance is the top alliance, it's useful to share occupation of level 6 cities so that it's easy to get honor points every<br> 
                time there is a Capitol War. Closing off access to the Capitol makes it difficult for all alliance members to get max honor points, thus<br> 
                losing out on potential rewards. Not impossible though, you would just have to organize battles with other alliances' members in the farms<br> 
                of the gray zone, or make sure your alliance members withdraw from Capitol as soon as they reach max individual rewards due to the reinforcement limit.

        <h2 id="Structure Upgrade Plan in Base">Structure Upgrade Plan in Base</h2>
            <p>
                HQ has two prerequisites for each level, one of them always being the Tech Center, and the other rotating between Hospital, Drill Ground,<br> 
                Barracks, Tank Center, Wall, and Alliance Center.<br>
                <br>
                The biggest reason anyone has a food shortage or an iron shortage is not because they don't get enough food or iron respectively, it's because<br> 
                they upgrade their structures in a manner that constantly drains one resource more than the other. To keep your resource consumption about<br> 
                even, plan your upgrades in pairs or trios (whether you do one after the other or have purchased construction slots to do them simultaneously).<br> 
                This is the scheme I recommend:<br>
                <br>
                Keep 2 Drill Grounds at same level as Wall<br>
                Keep 1 Hospital at same level as Tank Center (2nd hospital same level as Aircraft center, and 3rd hospital same level as Artillery Center)<br>
                Alliance Center can be paired with Gear Factory (until Alliance Center is 23 and Gear Factory is 20)<br>
                <br>
                Structures to keep at Max level or near max level:<br>
                <br>
                Training Bases (until they are at 25)<br>
                Smelters (0-4 levels below HQ, also slowing down around mid 20s)<br>
                Material Workshops (2-6 levels below HQ, also slowing down around early to mid 20s)<br>
                2 Barracks (see deeper strategy in Troop/Unit Training section)<br>
                <br>
                Structures you can start ignoring early:<br>
                <br>
                Fields and Mines. Stop somewhere between 15 and 20. Upgrading these higher than that starts to have a null or negative effect. (Tarna here I stopped at level 18)<br>
                Warehouses - these are essentially useless<br>
                Builder Hut & Tavern - only upgrade as needed, but the benefit drops off very quickly.<br>

        <h2 id="UR Shards (Weekly Repeatable)">UR Shards (Weekly Repeatable)</h2>
            <p>
                - Arms Race = 14/week (with a chance to get up to 7 more)<br>
                - Campaign Store = 10/week<br>
                - Duel = 6/week (can push to 12/week but it's not sustainable for f2p)<br>
                - Trucks = 10/week (lots of range for this one depending on your team, how often you roll and manage to keep them, etc., and I may get closer to 15/week here)<br>
                - Mystery/Tactical Chests = 10?/week (hard to tell, completely controlled by RNG)<br>
                - VIP 10+ Activated = 7/week (I only recently reached this, which combined with the added campaign store brought up my average)<br>
                - Alliance Store = 5/week<br>
                - Honor Store ≈ 2.2/week (refreshes 10 monthly)<br>
                - Secret Missions = 2/week (every 3 days there is one guaranteed, but the ceiling is higher depending on luck, perhaps averaging 5/week)<br>
                - VIP 11+ = 5 or 10/week in the VIP store (this doesn't apply to me or mostly f2p, but I'm listing it anyways even though I forget the actual number)<br>
